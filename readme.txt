Simple Site Offline by Beta is a super simple but versatile site-offline plugin. No bells and whistles, just straight to the point.

== Description ==
Site offline plugins are made awesome again with this piece of code. While most site offline plugins are bulky, intrusive and annoying this one is as light as a feather and has no paid options. The nav item is neatly tucked away within the settings menu so it feels like it is part of Wordpress.

Super Simple Site Offline contains the following features:
* Simple enable and disable button and settings page.
* Custom background, display text and logo for the ones who have a logo.
* A redirect option for if you want to close a site and make sure all the trafic is forwarded to the new site.


== Installation ==
1. Upload the unpacked folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the settings menu and activate the offline mode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can it do a redirect? =
Oh yes it sure can! The best redirect you've ever seen.

= Is half of it unusable because I have to pay? =
No. The entire thing is free and it will be in the future.

= What about foo bar? =
To answer to foo bar dilemma. We still don't know how the foo hit the bar. But 42 is always the answer as far as I'm concerned.

== Screenshots ==
1. Some of the options you can work with all neatly tucked away under the settings tab.
2. Even some custom CSS, and header information and Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager magic is possible.
3. Select your logo and enjoy a classic Wordpress view.
4. If you want a background image, no problem! Branding is really simple.
